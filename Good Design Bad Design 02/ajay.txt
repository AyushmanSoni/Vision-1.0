in the given design the color are not very contrast so i tried to make it look attractive
and contrasting by using the red and green theme 
the text were looking very dull i tried to make it noticable and immersing by making the larger and more readable
the icons very also not so clear or intuitive i tried to improve it
i tried to make the layout more cleaner and organized so that it will be user
to find what they are looking for
