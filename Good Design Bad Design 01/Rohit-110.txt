Login Screen:
    1. The center box splitted does non-linearly was looking absurd which I made a complete box and put the login section in it giving proper indentation in it.
    2. There were a lot of apps making in the second box making the screen very crowdy along with login screen so I provided option more so if anyone want he/she can jump to next page.
    3. Instead of giving the back and Guide at bottom I gave it top, as inn many apps this is common design, and as much u keep common that much is simpler for user to adjust.
Search Screen:
    1. I made the date selection option evenly distributed by making the selected date in center.
    2. All the options were no uniformly distributed so i changed that.
    3. Instead of providing recent searches I gave the screen little space remmoving it.
