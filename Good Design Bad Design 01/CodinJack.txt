First Screen:-
1. Looks cluttered and overwhelming
2. The box shapes are very random.
3. The text in the "More Apps" section is coming out of the box.

I've arranged the boxes neatly and aligned everything properly.
Each digit of the 4-digit password has its own box.
I even placed the "Agent Login using OTP" button right after the login box for easy access.

Second Screen:-
1. There is a lack of visual hierarchy.
2. The layout is inconsistent. It looks like the elements have been randomly placed.
3. The screen is cluttered with a lot of text and buttons, which can be overwhelming for users.

I have tried to arrange everything thoughtfully.
I placed the information box right after the "Search trains" button for a user-friendly experience. 
This design ensures a seamless flow, enhancing accessibility and convenience for users interacting with the interface.
