The current IRCTC app design has some limitations that could be improved upon:
    It has a cluttered and overwhelming interface, making it difficult to navigate and find the necessary information.
    The colors are dark and drab, which does not reflect the excitement of travel and movement. Buttons have poor gradient.
    The app is not intuitive, making it difficult for first-time users to understand how to use the app.

Given improved design has addressed these limitations by:
    Using a cleaner, more streamlined interface with intuitive navigation.
    Implementing a brighter color palette that reflects the excitement of travel.
    Making the app more user-friendly, with clear instructions and intuitive navigation for first-time users.
