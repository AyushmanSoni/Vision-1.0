The current design has a lot of clutter and visual noise, which can be overwhelming for users.
The color palette is inconsistent and lacks a cohesive visual hierarchy, making it difficult for users to understand what elements are important.
The alignment of elements is not always consistent, leading to a disjointed user experience.

Changes I have made:
Streamline the design by removing unnecessary elements and simplifying the layout.
Establish a consistent color palette that prioritizes hierarchy and usability.
Align elements consistently to create a more cohesive and intuitive user flow.
